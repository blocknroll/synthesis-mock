###Synthesis
--------------------------------------------

Synthesis is a project to explore Node.js, Event-Driven-Development, and real-time web sockets.

At this stage, an Express server listens for sensor information and updates a web dashboard in real time via socket.io.

The data is mocked-in for now, but will later be provided by sensors hooked up to a Raspberry Pi.
